# netChanger
Allows you to select from your various network adapters and move them to be dynamic or link local addressing. Also can capture current IP to be recalled after

 I have found myself in situations where I have needed to do this a lot when setting up a network so this makes it quicker.

 Select adapters on the left, read current settings on right, modify with buttons on bottom

Windows and chrome find the executable to be suspicious. If you have any concerns you can run the uncompiled .ps1 in Powershell as an administrator.
