# netChanger
Allows you to select from your various network adapters and move them to be dynamic or link local addressing. Also can capture current IP to be recalled after

 I have found myself in situations where I have needed to do this a lot when setting up a network so this makes it quicker.

 Select adapters on the left, read current settings on right, modify with buttons on bottom
